## About The Project

This is a small project to practice HTML, CSS and Javascript. The task was to compile an interactive evaluation component, where when you click on the appropriate number, you switch to a thank you page and display the evaluation, as well as the closest possible appearance to the plan.

## Built in

1. HTML5
2. CSS
3. Javascript

## What I learned

This is also a smaller project of mine, where I mainly practiced javascript. I had a hard time learning and understanding how it works, but even these small tasks help me to get better at it. I also learned a lot about what happens when the button is clicked.

## Acknowledgment

Thanks to everyone who gives feedback on my solution. It definitely helps you find new ways to code and find easier solutions!
